# Neural-Data-Decoding
Mathematical mapping of brain activity by decoding neural data using pattern recognition.

In most neuroscientific experiments, we are interested in mapping brain activity with some intuition or meaning. What is neural decoding? Simply put, it is a mathematical mapping from the brain activity to the outside world. In the sensory domain, the outside world consists of the received visual, auditory, or other sensory information. In the motor domain, the outside world consists of the state of the skeletomuscular system. This is the inverse of neural encoding, which maps the outside world to brain activity. Previously in the neural encoding project we looked at how a cosine tuning curve specifies how a neuron modulates its firing rate depending on the upcoming direction of movement. In contrast, estimating this movement direction from one (or many) observed firing rate(s) is an example of neural decoding. Because signals about motor intention precede movement, decoding can be thought of as “mind reading.” Neuroscientists seek to predict an action as soon as it is intended, before it ever takes place, through neural decoding. Neural decoding can also be thought of as pattern recognition. A set of neuronal spike times represents a pattern, and the goal of the decoder is to figure out which stimuli or movements are associated with which patterns.
